# NLP-Based Debugging: A Systematic Literature Review
We systematically categorize debugging-related activities into three major groups: **Bug Reproduction**, **Bug Localization**, and **Bug Report Analysis**.  
This repository is based on a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of **57 research papers published between 2010 and 2025** that leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

We welcome researchers and practitioners to contribute to this repository and help advance the collective knowledge in the field of **NLP-driven software debugging**.
